    Mars Weather API - "https://mars.nasa.gov/rss/api/?feed=weather&category=insight_temperature&feedtype=json&ver=1.0"


Note!
The mars Insight has unfortunately stopped working after 4 years: https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-retires-insight-mars-lander-mission-after-years-of-science
Right now the api contains the data up until day 681. So this website doesnt provide real time data on the weather on mars today.
